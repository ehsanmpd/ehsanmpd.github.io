I am a Principal Engineer and Architect at [Swisscom AG](https://www.swisscom.ch).

I hold a PhD from the [School of Computer and Communication Sciences](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/) at [EPFL](École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne). My PhD thesis focused on formal analysis of time-sensitive networks, where latency, jitter and packet-loss are key factors, using Network Calculus.
