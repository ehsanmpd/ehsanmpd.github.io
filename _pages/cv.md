Work experience
======
* 2025-now: **Swisscom**, System Architect
  * Designing and proposing high-level architecture and data models for the connectivity of various integration systems.
  * Working in close collaboration with business to provide consultation to the customer.
  * Collaboration with project management and system architects to align the teams with respect to the large solution.

* 2025-now: **Swisscom**, Principal DevOps Engineer and Tech Lead
  * Leading and facilitating technical discussions across Swisscom to accelerate project development.
  * Collaborating with the product owner on project planning and task breakdowns.
  * *Supporting other teams across Swisscom for cloud-native transformation.

* 2023-2025: **Swisscom**, Senior DevOps Engineer
  * Architected and implemented a transformation from legacy software to a cloud-native architecture using Kubernetes and operators, to enhance scalability for mobile private network (MPN) provisioning.
  * Developed custom resources and controllers for Kubernetes powered by Kubebuilder. The source code is in GoLang, integrated with NetConf to automate MPN provisioning. 
  * Maintained the legacy code developed in Java for MPN automation.
  * Managed operations and troubleshooting for MPN, effectively resolving complex technical issues.

* 2018-2022: **EPFL**, Researcher
  * Led the research in close collaboration with the industrial partner for the project.
  * Worst-case analysis of time-sensitive networks in terms of delay, delay-jitter and buffer bounds.
  * Worst-case analysis of packet misordering and the impact of re-sequencing buffers.
  * Delivered the analysis in terms of [IETF RFC9320] (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9320.html).
  * Designing an architecture of damper, as mechanisms to provide bounded delay and low delay-jitter, in large-scale time-sensitive networks.
  * Formal calculation of delay and delay-jitter bounds in a network of dampers under general network settings with non-ideal clocks.
  * Developed a TSN computation tool in Python (based on the FT-TFA tool) to evaluate dampers and re-sequencing buffers in a scalable framework.

* 2017-2018: **EPFL**, Intern
  * Proposed a heuristic algorithm for routing of critical flows using linear programming in a time-sensitive network with DRR schedulers. 

* 2014--2016: **EPFL**, Network Optimization Laboratory (Tehran Polytechnic)
  * Proposed a near-optimal heuristic energy-aware algorithm for routing of flows in green networks.
  * Modeling the energy-aware routing as a constrained MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) optimization problem.
