Network calculus is often used to prove delay bounds in deterministic networks, using arrival and service curves. We consider a FIFO system that offers a rate-latency service curve and where packet transmission occurs at line rate without pre-emption. The existing network calculus delay bounds take advantage of the service curve guarantee but not of the fact that transmission occurs at full line rate. In this letter, we provide a novel, improved delay bound which takes advantage of these two features. Contrary to existing bounds, ours is per-packet and depends on the packet length. We prove that it is tight.
