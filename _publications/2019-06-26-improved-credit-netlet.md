In time-sensitive networking (TSN), it is important to formally prove per-flow latency and backlog bounds. To this end, recent works have applied network calculus and obtained latency bounds from service curves. The latency component of such service curves is directly derived from upper bounds on the values of the credit counters used by the credit-based shaper (CBS), an essential building-block of TSN. In this letter, we derive and formally prove credit upper bounds for the CBS, which improve on existing bounds.
